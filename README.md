## üöÄ Introduction

Welcome to this comprehensive, beginner-friendly guide on component-driven development using Storybook UI in React Native. This tutorial leverages the power of Expo and Expo Router to provide a robust learning experience.

## üéØ What You'll Learn

1. Core principles of component-driven development
2. Harnessing Storybook UI to enhance your development workflow
3. Bootstrapping a React Native project with Expo
4. Seamlessly integrating Storybook UI into your Expo project
5. Implementing smooth navigation with Expo Router
6. Crafting and showcasing reusable components
7. Industry best practices for component-driven development

## üõ† Prerequisites

Before diving in, make sure you have:

- A basic understanding of JavaScript and React
- Node.js and npm installed on your development machine
- Your preferred code editor ready to go

## üìö Tutorial Sections

1. Introduction to Component-Driven Development
2. Setting Up Your Expo Project
3. Integrating Storybook UI
4. Creating Your First Component
5. Navigating with Expo Router
6. Building a Robust Component Library
7. Best Practices and Pro Tips

## Getting Started

### Using My Repository

To quickly get started with the pre-configured environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using:
    ```shell
        git clone https://github.com/FastheDeveloper/RN_ComponentDrivenDevelopment_Storybook.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies by running:
    ```shell
        yarn
    
    # or

        npm install
    ```

### Setting Up from Scratch


1. Creating your expo react native application:
    ```shell
        npx create-expo-stack@latest
    ```
    Running the above command will create a boilerplate application after asking a few configuration questions.
    
    <!-- ![Console Setup](./tutorialImages/setupImage.png) -->
    <img alt="Console Setup" src="./tutorialImages/setupImage.png" width="700" />

    <br/>

2. Setup Storybook In The Project

    ```shell
        npx storybook@latest init
    ```
    This will add a new folder (.storybook) in your project directory
    <br/>

<br/>

3. Additional Configuration

    1. Create an app.config.js File:

    This configuration facilitates easy switching between Storybook UI for testing and the actual React Native application.
    <br/>
    This file defines the storybookEnabled constant based on the environment variable STORYBOOK_ENABLED. This helps determine whether to render Storybook or the main application.

    ```javascript
    
    export default ({ config }) => ({
        ...config,
        name: 'My_App_Name',  
        slug: 'My_App_Name', 
        extra: {
            storybookEnabled: process.env.STORYBOOK_ENABLED,
        },
    });
    ```

    2. Update package.json File:

    In the package.json file, add these Storybook scripts. We use these to pass that environment variable to our application, which swaps the entry point to the Storybook UI using cross-env to make sure this works on all platforms (Windows/macOS/Linux).


    ```json
    {
        "scripts": {
            "storybook": "cross-env STORYBOOK_ENABLED='true' expo start",
            "storybook:ios": "cross-env STORYBOOK_ENABLED='true' expo ios",
            "storybook:android": "cross-env STORYBOOK_ENABLED='true' expo android"
        }
    }
    ```

4. Setup Entry point (/app/index.tsx) with the env variable

    ```javascript
    import React from 'react'
    import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native'
    import Constants from 'expo-constants'


    function Page() {
    return (
        <View style={styles.container}>
        <View style={styles.main}>
            <Text className="text-white">This is the first page of your app.</Text>
        </View>
        </View>
    )
    }

    let AppEntryPoint = Page  

    if (Constants?.expoConfig?.extra?.storybookEnabled === 'true') {
    const StorybookUI = require('../.storybook').default
    AppEntryPoint = () => {
        return (
        <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
            <StorybookUI />
        </View>
        )
    }
    }

    export default AppEntryPoint

    ```

5. Run the App for Testing:

    To test the app, you can use one of the following commands depending on your target platform:

    ```shell 
        # Run on iOS
        yarn ios
    
    # or 
    
        # Run on Android
        yarn android
    ```

6. Run Storybook  to test :
    ```shell 
        # Run on iOS
        yarn storybook:ios
    
    # or 
    
        # Run on Android
        yarn storybook:android
    ```
   
<br/>
<br/>
